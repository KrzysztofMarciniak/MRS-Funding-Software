# Contributing to MRS-Funding-Software 🚀

Thank you for considering contributing to MRS-Funding-Software! We welcome contributions that help improve the platform, whether it's through code, documentation, or other means.

## What We Need 📝

- **Tests**: We need comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the platform. If you can write unit tests, integration tests, or any other kind of tests, your contributions would be highly valuable.
  
- **More Themes**: The platform supports theming, and we would love to see more creative themes. If you have design skills or ideas for new themes, feel free to contribute them.

- **Reworks of Big Parts of the Code**: If you see areas in the codebase that could be improved or refactored for better performance, readability, or maintainability, don't hesitate to propose changes.

## How to Run the Project 🛠️

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
cargo watch -x run

This command will watch for changes in the codebase and automatically re-run the project, making it easier to test your changes in real-time.
